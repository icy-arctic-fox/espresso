module Espresso
  # Mix-in to provide a macro for defining events and callbacks.
  # Exposes a single macro named `#event`.
  # This module can only be used on types that:
  # 1. Use `LibGLFW::Window`.
  # 2. Have a member `@pointer` that is a `LibGLFW::Window`.
  # 3. Define events where the first argument is a `LibGLFW::Window`.
  # This covers most of the callbacks in GLFW.
  private module EventHandling
    # Creates methods necessary for setting callbacks for events.
    # There are two methods created that are publicly exposed -
    # one to register a listener, and the other to deregister.
    # The registration method is prefixed with `on_`.
    # The deregistration method is `remove_*_listener`.
    #
    # The *name* argument is used to name these methods.
    # The *event_type* is the type of instance to pass to listener.
    # It also must have an initializer with the same arguments (and types) as the GLFW callback.
    # Lastly, the *function* is the name of the GLFW function used to set the callback.
    # For instance: `set_window_close_callback`.
    #
    # The comment block will be applied to the `on_*` method.
    # The deregistration method's documentation will be generated.
